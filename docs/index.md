# Adding coverage to your repository

Code coverage is a metric used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested. A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage. You can read more about the [basics of code coverage](https://blog.codacy.com/a-guide-to-code-coverage-part-1-code-coverage-explained/) on Codacy's blog.

To monitor the code coverage of your repository on Codacy you must generate coverage reports for each commit on your CI/CD workflow, and then upload the coverage data to Codacy.

Complete these main steps to set up coverage for your repository:

1.  **Generating coverage reports**

    Ensure that you're generating one of the code coverage report formats supported by Codacy on each push to your repository.

1.  **Uploading coverage data to Codacy**

    After each push to your repository, run the Codacy Coverage Reporter to parse your report file and upload the coverage data to Codacy.

1.  **Validating that the coverage setup is complete**

    Check if Codacy displays the coverage metrics for new commits and pull requests and troubleshoot the coverage setup if necessary.

The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the setup process.

## 1. Generating coverage reports {: id="generating-coverage"}

Before setting up Codacy to display code coverage metrics for your repository you must have tests and use tools to generate coverage reports for the source code files in your repository.

Consider the following when generating coverage reports for your repository:

-   There are many tools that you can use to generate coverage reports, but you must ensure that the coverage reports are in one of the formats that Codacy supports
-   If your repository includes multiple programming languages, you may need to generate a separate coverage report for each language depending on the specific languages and tools that you use
-   Make sure that you generate coverage reports that include coverage data for all source code files in your repository, and not just the files that were changed in each commit

The following table contains example coverage tools that generate reports in formats that Codacy supports:

### Handling unsupported languages

If you're generating a report format that Codacy doesn't support yet, [contribute with a parser implementation](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/tree/master/coverage-parser/src/main/scala/com/codacy/parsers/implementation) yourself or use one of the community projects below to generate coverage reports in a supported format:

-   [SlatherOrg/slather](https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather): generate Cobertura reports from Xcode coverage reports:

    ```bash
    gem install slather
    slather coverage -x --output-directory <report-output-dir> --scheme <project-name> <project-name>.xcodeproj
    ```

    This will generate a file `cobertura.xml` inside the folder `<report-output-dir>`.

-   [dariodf/lcov_ex](https://github.com/dariodf/lcov_ex): generate LCOV reports for Elixir projects
-   [chrisgit/sfdx-plugins_apex_coverage_report](https://github.com/chrisgit/sfdx-plugins_apex_coverage_report): generate LCOV or Cobertura reports from [Apex](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.code_apex_dev_guide_tools.htm&type=5) code coverage data
-   [danielpalme/ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator): convert between different report formats

!!! important
    Make sure that you [specify the language](uploading-coverage-in-advanced-scenarios.md#unsupported-languages) when uploading coverage for an unsupported language.

As a last resort, you can also send the coverage data directly by calling one of the following Codacy API endpoints:

-   [saveCoverage](https://api.codacy.com/swagger#savecoverage)
-   [saveCoverageWithAccountToken](https://api.codacy.com/swagger#savecoveragewithaccounttoken)

## 2. Uploading coverage data to Codacy {: id="uploading-coverage"}

After having coverage reports set up for your repository, you must use the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload them to Codacy.

The recommended way to do this is by using a CI/CD platform that automatically runs tests, generates coverage, and uses the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage report information for every push to your repository.

!!! note "Alternative ways of running the Codacy Coverage Reporter"
    Codacy makes available [alternative ways to run the Codacy Coverage Reporter](alternative-ways-of-running-coverage-reporter.md), such as by installing the binary manually or by using Docker, a GitHub Action, or a CircleCI Orb.

    However, the instructions on this page assume that you'll run the recommended [self-contained bash script `get.sh`](alternative-ways-of-running-coverage-reporter.md#bash-script) to automatically download and run the most recent version of the Codacy Coverage Reporter.    

1.  Set up an API token to allow Codacy Coverage Reporter to authenticate on Codacy:
    {: id="authenticate"}

    -   **If you're setting up coverage for one repository**, [obtain a project API token](../codacy-api/api-tokens/#project-api-tokens) and set the following environment variable to specify your project API token:

        ```bash
        export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=<your project API token>
        ```

    -   **If you're setting up and automating coverage for multiple repositories**, [obtain an account API Token](../codacy-api/api-tokens/#account-api-tokens) and set the following environment variables:

        -   **CODACY_API_TOKEN:** Your account API token.

        -   **CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER:** Git provider hosting the repository.

            Must be one of `gh`, `ghe`, `gl`, `gle`, `bb`, or `bbe` to specify GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Enterprise, Bitbucket, or Bitbucket Enterprise, respectively.

        -   **CODACY_USERNAME:** Name of your organization on the Git provider, or your username on the Git provider if you're using a personal organization.

        -   **CODACY_PROJECT_NAME:** Name of the repository for which you're uploading the coverage data.

        ```bash
        export CODACY_API_TOKEN=<your account API token>
        export CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER=<Git provider hosting the repository>
        export CODACY_USERNAME=<organization name or username on the Git provider>
        export CODACY_PROJECT_NAME=<repository name>
        ```

    !!! warning
        **Never write API tokens to your configuration files** and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy

        We recommend that you set API tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this.

1.  **If you're using Codacy Self-hosted** set the following environment variable to specify your Codacy instance URL:

    ```bash
    export CODACY_API_BASE_URL=<your Codacy instance URL>
    ```

1.  Run Codacy Coverage Reporter **on the root of the locally checked out branch of your Git repository**, specifying the relative path to the coverage report to upload:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh) report -r <coverage report file name>
    ```

    Check the console output to validate that the Codacy Coverage Reporter **detected the correct commit SHA-1 hash** and **successfully uploaded** the coverage data to Codacy. If you need help, [check the troubleshooting page](troubleshooting-coverage-cli-issues.md) for solutions to the most common issues while running the CLI.

    !!! note
        Be sure to also check the [instructions for more advanced scenarios](uploading-coverage-in-advanced-scenarios.md) while uploading the coverage data to Codacy, such as when running parallel tests, using monorepos, or testing source code in multiple or unsupported languages.

## 3. Validating that the coverage setup is complete {: id="validating-coverage"}

Codacy displays the code coverage in each branch, as well as the evolution of code coverage between commits and the code coverage variation introduced by pull requests.

Because of this, to ensure that all code coverage metrics are available on Codacy, you must have successfully uploaded coverage data and analyzed:

-   The last two commits in each branch
-   The common ancestor commit of each pull request branch and its target branch

!!! note "Example"
    The example below shows that after pushing a commit that correctly sets up coverage on the default branch:

    -   Codacy will report coverage metrics for all subsequent commits and pull requests relative to the default branch.

    -   Codacy won't report coverage metrics for commits and pull requests that are relative to older branches where the coverage setup wasn't performed yet.

        To solve this issue, you can rebase the old feature branch to update the common ancestor commit to one that already has coverage data.

    ![Setting up coverage on the default branch](images/coverage-validate.png)

Follow these instructions to validate that your coverage setup is working correctly:

1.  On Codacy, open your **Repository Settings**, tab **Coverage**, and observe the list of the most recent 50 coverage reports in the section **Test your integration**.

    Make sure that Codacy receives and processes the coverage data successfully for **at least two commits**.

    ![Testing the coverage integration](images/coverage-test-integration.png)

    If there are commits with a status different from **Processed**, please follow the troubleshooting instructions for the corresponding error status and click the button **Test integration** to display any new coverage reports uploaded to Codacy.

    ### Commit not found {: id="status-commit-not-found" style="color: #EF5454;"}

1.  Check that Codacy displays the coverage metrics for the latest commits and pull requests.

    ![Coverage metrics displayed on Codacy](images/coverage-codacy-ui.png)

    If Codacy doesn't display the coverage variation metric in pull requests (represented by `-`), make sure that you have uploaded coverage data for both:

    -   The common ancestor commit of the pull request branch and the target branch
    -   The head commit of the pull request branch

    The following diagram highlights the commits that must have received coverage data for Codacy to display the coverage variation metric on a pull request:

    ![Commits that must have received coverage data](images/coverage-pr-commits.png)
