# Authenticating using an Account API Token

If you'd like to automate uploading coverage for multiple repositories you can authenticate using an Account API Token:

1. Create an Account API token on Codacy. You can find the token in *Your account* → *API tokens*.
1. Set the API token in your terminal, replacing `%API_Token%` with your own token.
1. Set your repository name in your terminal, replacing `%Repo_Name%`.
1. Set your username in your terminal, replacing `%Username%`.

```bash
export CODACY_API_TOKEN=%API_Token%
export CODACY_PROJECT_NAME=%Repo_Name%
export CODACY_USERNAME=%Username%
```

!!! warning
    You should keep your API token well protected, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.
